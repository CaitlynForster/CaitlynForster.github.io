So you've found some artificial flowers floating around!
Currently we're trying to see look at floral preferences of floral visitors, when flowers are clumped together or dispersed

**FAQ**

![](/assets/img/perspex_flowers.jpg)

**What are the flowers made of?**
Our flowers are made of perspex, and we put stickers on them to change their colours. 

**Whats inside the tubes?**
We use nectar as a reward for insects that visit our flowers. This is a sugar water solution

**Why are they blue, yellow and white?**
These colours are shown to be pretty popular to bees and flies

**Why would bees visit these fake flowers**
We make our flowers high in sugar, and smell like flowers to attract pollinators - especially in winter there aren't that many flowers around so bees are more likely to discover ours
