I am an Associate Lecturer at the University of Sydney. In my recently completed PhD at the University of Sydney, I studied the behavioural ecology of bees and my current research uses behavioural economics to understand how insects pick flowers. Currently I'm also supervising projects on fly vision, and urban ecology of ants. I am an advocate for encouraging citizen science initiatives to get people outside enjoying nature. I am also passionate about Science communication, and one of my aims is to showcase affordable backyard science experiments that help us to understand our local ecosystems. While my academic focus has been on ant and bee behaviour, I like to pretend my PhD was actually in craft, as I have spent a lot of my time using 3D printing and tabletop craft machines to make effective and reproducible experimental equipment.
