I am a PhD candidate at the University of Sydney. My research focus is on combining work from behvaioural economics (basically, marketing tricks) and behavioural ecology to understand how insects pick flowers. I am also interested in using 3D printing and tabletop craft machines to make effective and reproducible experimental design. I like to use my skills in Science communication to encourage backyard science experiments that help students understand their local ecosystems.
