<p align="center"> I am an Associate Lecturer at the University of Sydney. I recently completed my PhD at the University of Sydney, where I studied bee behavioural ecology.
  
Currently, I am researching how we can use  behavioural economics to understand how insects pick flowers. I am also interested in how we can use citizen science to get people outside enjoying nature. I also spend some of my time doing Science communication, where much of my aims are to show people affordable backyard science experiments that help us understand our local ecosystems.
Most of my focus has been on ant and bee behaviour, but I like to pretend my PhD was actually in craft, as I have spent a lot of my time using 3D printing and tabletop craft machines to make effective and reproducible experimental design.
