I really enjoy writing about Ecology and entomology, and frequently write for The Department of Educations' [Scan Magazine](#scan-magazine), [The Conversation](#the-conversation) and have been involved in [educational videos](#video), [radio interviews](#radio) and podcast recordings. I have over 100 000 reads on articles written in the Conversation, and have written a mixture of pitched and commissioned articles on a range of topics from bee swarms to TikTok and the Olympics to Floods.
