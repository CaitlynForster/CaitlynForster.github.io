I have taught as a demonstrator, supervisor and guest lecturer at The University of Sydney and Western Sydney University. I have been involved in marking assignments and exams, as well as course development practicals.

**Units Taught**

_Animals and Us_
<br>This is a first-year unit aimed at understanding the complex relationship between humans and animals from cultural, economical and ecological perspectives. I taught this unit at a supervisory capacity and have been involved in course development and wrote and presented 2 guest lectures for this unit. One was on entomophagy, the other on how popular culture can influence peoples' perceptions of invertebrates.

_From Molecules to Ecosystems, The University of Sydney (2019-2021)_
<br>This is a first-year unit aimed at teaching students a range of skills from molecular biology to ecology. I taught this unit as a demonstrator and have marked exams and assessments.


_Human Biology, The University of Sydney (2017-2021)_
<br>This course is a first-year unit and teaches a broad range of human biological concepts including physiology, anatomy, medical science and histology. Students undertake a range of experiments and dissections. I taught this unit as a demonstrator and have marked exams and assessments.

_Introduction to Entomology, The University of Sydney (2017-2019)_
<br>This course involves teaching undergraduate students insect ecology, behaviour and taxonomy. We taught students how to identify insects to family. I taught as a demonstrator and an exam and assessment marker.


_Invertebrate Biology, Western Sydney University (2015-2018)_
<br>This course aims at teaching third-year students about terrestrial and freshwater aquatic invertebrates. This course involves teaching students fieldwork skills, identifying invertebrates to order, and conducting behavioural experiments. In this course I was a demonstrator.


_Genetics, Western Sydney University (2016-2018)_
<br>This course aims to teach 2nd year undergraduates the basics of genetics. Students learn important skills such as PCR. I was a demonstrator in this course.
